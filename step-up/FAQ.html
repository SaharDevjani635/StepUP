            <h3>Where are the Stay Spots located?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Our Boston Outpost is located in Epsom, NH. Our DC Outpost is a short distance from Shenandoah National Park in Stanardsville, VA. Our New York Outpost is nestled away in the beautiful woods of Catskill, NY. Our Atlanta Outpost is about a two hour drive away in Suches, Georgia. We reveal the exact address once you've booked.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>What are the cabins like?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Our cabins are tiny (around 140-200 square feet) and have been carefully designed by our team to include everything you need and nothing you don't. We provide cooking essentials like oil, salt and pepper, a tiny kitchen with pots and pans, non-perishable provisions like pasta, snacks and coffee for purchase, fresh linens and towels, heat, and a hot shower. Learn more about our cabins here. </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What's included?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Your booking includes a stay for two or four guests, depending on the cabin.  We will have fresh bed linens waiting for you, as well as bath towels, biodegradable shower products, and basic kitchen wares. Once you arrive, you can also purchase extras from the provisions. All cabins have their own outdoor space with a fire pit, picnic table and chairs. </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What are the provisions for purchase?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Each cabin is stocked with provisions for purchase to make your trip as easy as possible.  You can expect to find snacks and simple meals, with items such as: coffee, tea, pasta + sauce, s'mores, and popcorn. You will always find local firewood outside your cabin available for purchase. Use what you'd like and we'll simply send you the tab after checkout.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Are there other cabins around?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Yes, all of our Outposts feature a collection of cabins. We work hard to make sure each cabin has its own space, but expect to see other cabins on the land. </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What about cooking?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Each cabin is stocked with cooking essentials for use during your stay, including a two-burner stove, a mini-fridge, dining ware, silverware, a can opener, a pourover kettle, a pot, a pan, cooking/grilling utensils, kitchen knives, olive oil, and salt + pepper.  Paper towels and dish soap are also provided.  Feel free to cook inside on the stove top or outside over the fire, but please limit pot and pan use to the stove top only.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>What should I pack?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Our trips are designed to be minimal—we suggest you bring overnight essentials (toothbrush, toothpaste, toiletries), clothing, and anything you can’t live without. Our houses also include playing cards and an activity book. </p>
              </div>
              <h3>How do I get to my cabin?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>We reveal the exact location of your cabin once you book.  Each outpost is guaranteed to be a two hour drive (or less) from its respective city, without traffic.  We recommend that you drive there, but every location is accessible via public transit with a few extra steps. The adventure is part of the fun, so sit back and enjoy the magic of a true vacation.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Is there cell reception at the cabins?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Because of the secluded nature of our outposts, cell phone service may be a little spottier than normal. You may not get any reception at all—if this is the case, embrace the opportunity to unplug and relax. Each of the cabins is equipped with a landline for calls to the Acrostia team or to 911 in case of emergency. There is no WiFi and never will be.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>How do check in and check out work?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Check in begins at 3 PM (you can check in at any time after) and check out is at 11 AM. You’ll receive the exact location of your cabin in your booking confirmation email, and two hours before check in you’ll receive an email with your cabin name and personalized entry code (we’ll also text you your code the morning of your stay). Once you reach your cabin, simply enter the code on the door and begin to disconnect. When it comes time to head back to the real world, take a deep breath and be sure to press the lock button on the door before you go.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Is there a designated area to park?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>In most cases, you can feel free to park right next to your cabin. Other sites will have designated parking spaces about 150 feet away from each cabin.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Are there any rules that I need to know about?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Safety and ensuring a good experience for all of our guests is important to us. We ask that guests never leave a campfire unattended, to never leave food and/or trash outside, and no pitching tents. We also ask that guests don't play music outside of their cabins and to avoid yelling or making unnecessary noise. Violations are subject to a $100 charge, donated to local conservation groups.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Do you have a waitlist?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>We do!  If your search doesn't return any availability for your desired nights and you're feeling lucky, go ahead and join our waitlist by scrolling down to the bottom of the “find your cabin” page or by emailing our team at <a href="javascript:;">lodge@acrostia.house</a>  We'll get in touch lickety-split if a cabin becomes available for the nights you’ve requested.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Booking payments are fully refundable up to 15 days prior to the reservation. We're happy to partially refund your booking 8-14 days prior to your reservation, but less than a week's notice puts us in a tough spot. Acrostia won't be able to refund your payment if you cancel your booking less than 7 days prior.  Find our full terms here.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>What if I need to reschedule my stay?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>If you need to change your dates, your original booking will be canceled according to our cancellation policy above and we'll help you create a brand new reservation. Get in touch at <a href="javascript:;">lodge@acrostia.house</a></p>
